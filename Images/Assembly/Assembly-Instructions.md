# Please follow the below images to assemble your toolhead

Install a standard heatset into the front of the carraige mount

![image](https://github.com/leddhedd/BreakNeck/blob/main/Images/Assembly/1-2-rear%20carriage%20inserts.png)

insert a heatset into each of the holes shown, the carriage clamp can be used [EXCEPT WITH SMALL BEACON MOUNT] with an m3 SHCS with an m4 washer on it, loosely installed until after mounting to the rtail carriage

Insert a heatset into each of the highlighted holes above, square or hex nuts can be inserted into the yellow holes, and used in the same manner as the carriage clamp, with an m3SHCS and an m4 washer. once installed onto the rail carriage these can be tightened down to clamp onto the rail carriage more securely

**MICROSHERPA ONLY  ^^^^** insert heatsets into the front of the microsherpa block if using this part

![image](https://github.com/leddhedd/BreakNeck/blob/main/Images/Assembly/2-1-attach%20probe.png)

use the appropriate length aluminium standoffs to attach to the m3 screws inserted into the bottom of the rail carraige. ensure no part of the screw head is proud of the top surface, or it will interfere with rail mounting.

slide the beacon probe mount over the aluminium standoffs

![image](https://github.com/leddhedd/BreakNeck/blob/main/Images/Assembly/2-3-beacon%20attach.png)

attach the beacon to the bottom of the standoffs, ensuring to use LOW PROFILE or BUTTON HEAD screws. anything with a larger head **MAY HIT YOUR BED!!!!!!**

![image](https://github.com/leddhedd/BreakNeck/blob/main/Images/Assembly/2-4-attach%20hotend.png)

install the appropriate length m2.5 screws for your hotend, preferably using m3 or m2.5 washers to spread the load over the top surface

![image](https://github.com/leddhedd/BreakNeck/blob/main/Images/Assembly/2-5-attach%20fan.png)

install the front fan using 2 or 4 m2.5 screws

![image](https://github.com/leddhedd/BreakNeck/blob/main/Images/Assembly/2-6-attach%20extruder.png)

mount your extruder to the appropriate block. Hextrudort screws into the extruder from the front, microsherpa screws into the heatsets from the top of the extruder down

![image](https://github.com/leddhedd/BreakNeck/blob/main/Images/Assembly/3-1-push%20belts%20through.png)

Push your belts through the holes in the rear carriage facing side of the carriage mount, ensuring that the teeth of the belt sit into the recesses on the back

![image](https://github.com/leddhedd/BreakNeck/blob/main/Images/Assembly/3-2-install%20to%20rail.png)

place the carriage mount over the rail carriage, pull your belts tight through the part, and push any excess belt through the outside holes in the face, with the ends coming out the sides of the carriage.

secure the part to the rail with the 4 m3 SHCS , ensuring all belts are equal length and secured properly. you can at this point tighten the carriage clamp screw above the probe mount on the rear bottom of the rail carriage.

push the hotend and extruder blocks together as shown, and slide the assembly down over the rail carraige, making sure the screw holes align. you may cable tie the wiring at this stage, and all wires should only be attached to the block that their corresponding parts are attached to, allowing for easy dissasembly without cutting cable ties

![image](https://github.com/leddhedd/BreakNeck/blob/main/Images/Assembly/3-5-attach%20ducts.png)

slide the ducts straight backwards over the assembly

![image](https://github.com/leddhedd/BreakNeck/blob/main/Images/Assembly/3-6-main%20screws.png)

insert all 4 main mounting screws into the front of the duct, taking care not to cross thread things. the screw axis are deliberately out of alignment with the major axis, so the screws will locate at a slightly wonky angle going in, look through the front of the hole and firmly screw everything together.

![image](https://github.com/leddhedd/BreakNeck/blob/main/Images/Assembly/3-7-attach%20front%20cover.png)

Push the front cover over the 2510 fan. this is just a slip fit and holds on with friction
